Plugins are sold through paypal. These plugins are from external people, but modified by me.

DropsSummoner --> Enables the drop of boxes on the server (hydra box, stings, etc) of all types of boxes. This is completely random.
Jail_awards   --> Plugin to buy jail rewards
invisible_man --> It is a css game mode that chooses a random terrorist and turns him into a predator with 5000hp of life and becomes invisible every few seconds.
redbull       --> This add-on is also for jail, you type !redbull in the chat and it gives you a set of skills like 25hp, 25kevlar, and speed.
SetSkins      --> This plugin makes a team you select respawn with a specific skin.
Only admins - no admins --> This helps you to select admins only or non-admins.      @admins --> Admins only   @!admins--> Non-admins people only
Tienda DM     --> It is a store for the DM - Battle royale that some servers have that is based on jail_awards that allows you to buy prizes.
